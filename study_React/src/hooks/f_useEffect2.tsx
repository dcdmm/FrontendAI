/*
Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you “step outside” of React and synchronize your components with some external system like a non-React widget, network, or the browser DOM. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component’s state when some props or state change), you shouldn’t need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.

    // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect

    useEffect(() => {
        setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);

function Form() {

    const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
    // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering
    const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
    // ...
}

When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, don’t put it in state. Instead, calculate it during rendering.
